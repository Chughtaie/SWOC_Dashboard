Welcome to SWOC (Smart Waste Optimized Collection)

“Smart Waste Optimized Collection (SWOC)” is a mobile application with web based dashboard. Our FYP is part of a project that has recently been funded by HEC under NRPU. The main functionality of our application is to propose a cost-effective, optimized and time saving solution to the ongoing solid waste collection management system. That is done by generating optimal routes using backtracking search algorithm and then providing the optimal routes to respective trucks through mobile application. Plus, to lessen the burden on government waste collection transporters, our app is going to have an option to register private contractors who can be hired are awarded reward points accordingly.
Therefore we aim to develop an optimized and efficient AI-driven solid waste management using smart sensored bins (that’ll track the fill level of the bin) and accordingly create an optimized route and also check for optimization enroute by considering several factors such as traffic, forecasting bin levels by the end of specific time etc. Our system will also include forecasting the levels and status of bin by analysis previous behaviour of bin filling. The major aim is to reduce the cost of waste collection process by developing an efficient optimization algorithm, forecasting bin levels to further optimize and involve private contractors for waste collection. Plus, our system will also monitor truck capacity and bins capacity to further accommodate the cost and time effectiveness.
Hence, we will develop a system to reduce the overall waste collection cost and potentially lessen the burden on official authorities by hiring private contractors. For example, if the official trucks are not available at the moment, or there is a clash between the capacities of truck and bins, government authorities can hire private contractors and outsource them and they can then be rewarded. 


In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You also have to run the following:
open folder with server/server.js and run node server.js

open folder with server.py and run python python/.dist/server.py
